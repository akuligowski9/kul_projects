# Here’s what you do:
#  1. Go to bitbucket.org, github.com, or gitorious.org with your favorite web browser and
# search for “python.”
#  2. Avoid any project that mentions “Python 3.” That’ll only confuse you.
#  3. Pick a random project and click on it.
#  4. Click on the Source tab and browse through the list of fi les and directories until you fi nd
# a .py fi le (but not setup.py—that’s useless).
#  5. Start at the top and read through it, taking notes on what you think it does.
#  6. If any symbols or strange words seem to interest you, write them down to research later.

#I've done this on several code reviews. I'm going to lookup gitorious.org... this site looks down outside of git repos
#They also listed these sites to consider: launchpad.net, sourceforge.net, freecode.com
#I've browsed around but I've practiced reading what I don't know often for the past 5 months. I'm going to skip this exercise
