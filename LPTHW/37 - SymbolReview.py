# Understanding other people's code:
# First, print out the code you want to understand. Yes, print it out, because your eyes and brain
# are more used to reading paper than computer screens. Make sure you only print a few pages at
# a time.
# Second, go through your printout and make note of the following:
#  1. Functions and what they do.
#  2. Where each variable is fi rst given a value.
#  3. Any variables with the same names in different parts of the program. These may be
# trouble later.
#  4. Any if- statements without else clauses. Are they right?
#  5. Any while- loops that might not end.
#  6. Finally, any parts of code that you can’t understand for whatever reason.

# Third, once you have all this marked up, try to explain it to yourself by writing comments as you
# go. Explain the functions, how they are used, what variables are involved, and anything you can
# to fi gure this code out.
# Lastly, on all the diffi cult parts, trace the values of each variable line by line, function by function.
# In fact, do another printout and write in the margin the value of each variable that you need to
# “trace.”
# Once you have a good idea of what the code does, go back to the computer and read it again
# to see if you fi nd new things. Keep fi nding more code and doing this until you do not need the
# printouts anymore.
